                    <p>Yeah. That event doesn't happen until tonight, so you must be very careful not to run into your other self. Let me give you some money. (He pulls out a case, and opens it. Inside are various money bills from different times. He finds a note from 1955 and gives it to Marty.) Have to be prepared for all monetary possibilities! Get yourself some 50's clothes. Check Doc. (Marty leaves, then Doc calls after him.) Something inconspicuous!</p>
                    <p>(Biff grabs George's arm and twists it.) Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. (Back of the Auditorium) Give me a hand, Lorenzo. (Pops the trunk open) Ow, dammit, man, I sliced my hand. (Marty quickly climbs out.)</p>
                    <p>Just one. (in disbelief) Just one?! C'mon, Doc. There's a feller that can't hold his liquor. Gimme some coffee... black. Joey, coffee!</p>
                    <p>Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning? Yeah. What's going on? Where have you been all week? Working. Where's Einstein, is he with you?</p>
                    <p>They're in your suede jacket, honey. (She is the first to notice Marty.) Marty. We thought you went to the lake. You wore that to the lake? Thank God you guys are all back to normal. Hey Marty, who're you supposed to be, Clint Eastwood? Right. I gotta go get Jennifer. (He gets into his truck.)No, it was The Enchantment Under The Sea Dance. Our first date. It was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George? Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him. (Bedroom - 1:00 am) (Marty's asleep in his clothes. The phone rings, and Marty wakes up and answers it.) Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you? Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly.</p>
                    <p>(Lorraine goes down the stairs. Biff turns to Marty.) As for you, I’ll be back up here in an hour, so you'd better not be! (Biff leaves, slamming the doors as he goes. 3-D, Match and Skinhead follow him.) He was right, and I was wrong. Mom, Mom, what are you saying? You're actually defending him!Joey, coffee! (Marty looks out the window and sees the clock. It reads 7:45.) (Road) (Tannen and his gang are riding fast to get into town.) Giddy up, hey, hoot!</p>
                    <p>No, no, no Marty, that could resolve in a...(Doc realizes something and gives a "Huh!" groan) Great Scott! Jennifer could conceivably encounter her future self, the consequences of that could be disastrous. Doc, what do you mean? I foresee two possibilities. One - coming face-to-face with herself thirty years older could put her into shock and she could simply pass out. Or two - the encounter could create a time paradox, the results of which could cause a chain reaction that would unravel the very fabric of the space-time continuum and destroy the entire universe. Granted, that's the worse case scenario. The destruction might, in fact, be very localized, limited to merely our own galaxy. (worried) Well, that's a relief. (The police car takes off and passes Marty and Doc.)</p>
                    <p>I don't worry. (she leans over and kisses him, then leans back with a weird look on her face.) This is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it? Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense. Someone's coming. (Marty thinks it's George, but is surprised when the car door is jerked open and Biff drags him out of the car.) You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him.</p>
                    <p>But was this man tall, with great big brown puppy dog eyes and long silvery flowing hair?? You know him! (turns back around) Emmett! (She gets up and pulls on a cable that causes the train to stop. Everyone jerks as the train comes to a quick stop. Clara jumps off the train and starts running back towards Hill Valley.) (Hill Valley - Main Street)</p>
